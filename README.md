A react native application that allows users to browse a list of products and add to cart.

## Features
- Product list screen displaying available products
- Product detail screen with detailed information about a product

## External API Integration
The FakeStore API simulates an e-commerce store, providing endpoints for products, categories, and more.
To fetch data from the FakeStore API, you can use libraries like fetch or axios. I personally used axios
